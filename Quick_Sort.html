/*
Diff in merge sort and quick sort

1) In case of merge sort, merge function is necessary. Keep that in mind. Merge function requires that the two portions of array are sorted and merge just converts them to one by comparing each list.

2) In case of quick sort the, partition function is necessary. Remember the pivot selecting technique. Go with last element in array as pivot. The partition function makes sure that the pivot is at correct position. Means all elements which are placed left are less than it and all elements which are placed right to it are greater than or equal to it.

3) Quick sort is in place sort while merge sort requires auxilary space of two arrays.

4) Quick sort doesn't make sure the order of elements remains same as that of original array in case of elements are same. Merge sort makes sure order remains same
